# Weather-App
Currently this repository holds a weather app running on a node server and using the Angular framework that shows you the weather in your area based on geolocation.

To run the app on your own computer pull down the repository, make sure you have Node installed and run an npm install from the directory that you put the app in. 

You will need an API key for weather underground which can be gotten here:  https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/
That API key should be saved as an Environment Variable on your system under the Variable name weatherKey.

Once you have that set up you should be able to run npm start from the apps top level and connect via local host.
